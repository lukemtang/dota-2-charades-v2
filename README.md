<h2>What is Dota 2 Charades?</h2>

A WIP multiplayer browser-based guessing game with questions based upon the video game Dota 2
Dota 2 Charades is a browser based multiplayer game, where players will take it turns to draw various objects and names from the popular online video game Dota 2.

<h3>A note about "V2"<h3>

<p>I had previously started this project, but I decided to start afresh using React's create-react-app, which handles a lot of the boilerplate and has made this project easier to create.</p>

<h3>About the development of this project<h3>

<p>I intend to develop this project in stages. I firstly want to create a simple single player game, where a player has to guess the name of various dota 2-related sounds and pictures, which are randomly chosen by the game. This would still include a scoring system and a stopwatch.</p> 
<p>I would then like to extend this functionality to real time multiplayer; that is, players on different clients connect and play in a single lobby. At this point I will implement the drawing canvas to introduce other ways of scoring other than typing.</p>

<p>The images folder contains all ability icons that players will guess.</p>

<p>After this, I intend to create an Android version of the game; I think the casual nature of the gameplay lends itself to being enjoyed on mobile devices.</p>

This is expressed simply below:
